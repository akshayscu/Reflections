How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It is important to have some kind of version control to keep in check the changes that are happening!
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can know what i did, so i dont need to keep everything in my headspace plus it is good to know how the flow of the development work was
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Better, since it gives you the power to do so and we are the best judge, con-there is no way to keep it automated, so if we miss we miss
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think it helps programmers with code maintainance
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log provides general info while git diff shows the difference etween commits using the commit id!
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Since, i dont have to keep all in my head!
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
i want to use it for my projects!!!
